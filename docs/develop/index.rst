API
===

The LNL Database has a built-in REST API for communicating with external applications. While the API currently only has
access to a limited portion of the database, it makes LNL's data much more accessible. Our API enables developers like
you to create all new interfaces and extensions for LNL's web services. We hope it will spark greater creativity and
innovation as we strive to offer the best experience possible for our members and our clients.
